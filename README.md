#Javascript

Javascript project created for the third week of my full-stack development course covering the basics of Javascript.

It is a simple ToDo List: 
- to write a todo just fill the input and press "AGGIUNGI" (Italian for "add")
- when a todo is completed just click on it and it will disappear
